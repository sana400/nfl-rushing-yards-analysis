# 🏈 nfl-rushing-yards-analysis
A collection of various graphs, `do` files and data sets tracking various statistics of NFL quarterback players in their 2020 season, as well as Big Ten teams. 

### 🤔 Where to start? 
Data files for creating graphs can be found as `.dta` files and as a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet can be imported into STATA while `.dta` files can be used right away. 
`Do` files require their respective data sets to run. 

### 🪶 Variations on a do...
Images of graphs created using the data and `do` files are provided as examples. Data can be interpreted and adjusted in the `do`. Data templates can also be adjusted for more recent seasons. 

### 🔢 Quarterback numbers?
For the quarterback 2020 files, quarterback ratings are determined using a series of other statistics. More information can be found online on the calculation. Numbers used in the data file were taken from the middle of the 2020 season and can be adjusted for a new season or as stats change.
